		        <h3>ICT > E-Learning</h3><br><br><br>
		        <p>
		            In its continual effort to “go for IT”, I.H.S has introduced e-learning for grades 1 to 8 in the subjects of English and Maths. The enormous educational value of e-learning lies in its interactive, activity-based, audio-visual format that appeals to the different learning styles of each individual child. Both the content and methodology of e-learning will help to develop the creative and critical thinking skills of learners.

                    Specially designed software, customized to the I.H.S syllabus, will further sharpen e-skills and develop a tech-savvy generation. Students are exposed to a whole new learning experience with interactive Smart boards and online testing in place.
