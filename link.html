		Lord William Benting from his p8 
		to spread English language all over the country. 
		The activities of the school began on the verenda of a dochala room made of tile near
		Borokuthi on the bank of the river Padma. At the beginning it was a private and full
		free school. At that time there was no allocation of government fund for the school.</p> <br>
		<p>So, the school continued with the assistance and cooperation from the European officers
		lawyers, businessmen, men of other professionals, the rajas and zamidars of Puthia, 
		Dubalhati, Dighapatiya, Bolihar and others living in Rajshahi. But the school received 
		William Adam’s recommendation in 1835 after a visit to the school. The school was 
		nationalized on 20 June 1836 after the recommendation had been sent to the government.
		The government took up the Boalia School as baghata School and appointed 
		ShardaParashadBosu as the Head Master. In that year the total students of the school 
		were 83. Among them 78 were Hindus, 2 Muslims and 3 Christians. In 1998the student
		increased to 188. The standard of education was very high.
 
		In its 150th celebration (1986) Sekander Abu Jafore wrote Rajshahi Collegiate School
		is one of the three government and Higher Secondary Schools in the then undivided Bengal 
		during British reign in 1836. The another two were. Hare School of Kolkata and Murshidabad
	English High School in 1850 TK 1 was fixed as free for each student of higher classes. As 
		a result the number of students decreased. In 1844 and 1845, 1 student in both year and in 1847,
		3 students got junior scholarship. In 1849 a spacious brick-built building was built in 1857
		the total students rose to 146.</p><br>
		
 
		<p>I	n 1990 two rooms of College were added to Boalia government English school. Most probably, since 
		then, the school was named Rajshahi Collegiate School. In 1874 two additional buildings of the 
		school were built with the financial assistance of the great queen ShorotSundory Devi of Puthia. 
    	In 1907 Fuller Hostel was built with the financial assistance of the then governor of Bengal Mr
. 		Fuller and with the active cooperation of politician Mr. Khan BahadurEmaduddin. In that very
		year a separate Hindu Hostel was built for the school. 1912 the then governor the Bengal came to
		visit the school for the first time. The total students were 500 then. In 1926 then Hindu hostel
				was placed to raja Promothnath (P.N) hostel.
		In 1990 the students of the school decreased to 300 for Anti British political movement.

		In school history the mentionable additions this year were :
		Formation of Boy Scout
				Organisation of junior Red Cross
		Morning Shift Started for the first time in 1990
		Until 1990 Morning shift was from class three to six and Day shift was from class seven to ten. 
		In May 1991 by a government order “Double Shift” was fully introduced. At present Morning Shift runs from 
		class 3 to 10 and Day shift also runs from 3 to 10 having 2 sections in each class and each shift.
 
		The school encompasses 0.9725 acres of land. Any source or information regarding how the land was
		obtained is not found out. An unknown amount of land was acquired by the government from the total
		land for road extension.
 
		For the increasing demand of population several multi-storied buildings have been constructed 
		in the school campus to accommodate more students.

		through much encouragement and enthusiasm. An ex-student Abdul Matin (batch-1946) the then 
		chairman of Fedarel Insurance Company, Bangladesh gave away 82 thousand taka (firstly 54 thousand 
		then 28 thousand) to the school to introduce Abdul Matintalency scholarship in this 150th anniversary.
		In 2008 Eleven Class was opened in science and commerce group. In 2011 the students 
		first appeared at the HSC examination. Total examinee was 99. Among them from science group
